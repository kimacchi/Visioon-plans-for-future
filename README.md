# Visioon Project

This project is just in the current state of initial planning and brain-storming the core features.

Although, I do want to lay out some information regarding my plans and how I will go on with the project regarding the technologies I use.


The project is currently called <strong>Visioon</strong>, although, even that might even change. Since I am really bad with coming up with business names.

As of now, I am thinking about going on with the open source approach since I might (and probably will) need some extra support from people. But that might completely change, as I am also thinking to possibly make this project profitable through ads, premium features etc. Though, I believe I will have a part of the codebase open source at the very least.

### A little insight into how this project is going to be developed.

- As the time being, I am planning on developing the project all by myself. As I look to this project as a serious way gaining recognition and experience.
- I have built numerous websites (two of which being used day-to-day) with React. So React Native is my preffered framework at the moment for the mobile. (I have never developed a mobile app but I am familiar with mobile design flow and proficient in react.)
- I am thinking of using Firebase as my backend although I am a little conserned that free tier might not cut it in the future and I am extremely broke.(But I do think I will go with this option since I really love working with NoSQL databases and I just simply love Firebase)
- This project won't have any deadlines to meet at least at the beginning. As I also work as a freelancer as well as having college. So it may take, months, at the very best. I do think it will take at least a year or two though.
- I will design all the pages etc. myself. Although I may hire someone to design specific things such as logos or pages that I struggle to design in the future.


### Let me tell you a bit of the project itself.
##### Take it with a grain of salt since it is still extremely early for the project and everything is open to change.

- The project is for mainly teams, although it could be used as a single person. It is a combination of a social-media and a project management app as well as to improve and accelarate the progress of the said projects.

- You could be a part of a community in the app, which will be controlled by the said community's admins.

- You could as well create a community yourself which then you can either invite someone or accept/reject someone's join request.

- There will be roles that you can create in each community that could be assigned to the members. Such as, giving someone the role of "back-end" team will allow them to only see sub-projects and assignments that has their role in the "allowed to view" rule.

- The roles will also take place as to if they can only view or view and write to a sub-project.

- I do not think there should be an out-of-the-box implementation of hierarchy roles as some managers or small teams may not want it, on the other hand, creating a hierarchy amongst the roles would be possible if you manually set them.

- There will also be member-specific assignments which only the member assigned to that would see. You could choose between member-specific or role-specific choices as well as an "open to anyone" choice.

- Community managers can create an invitation code and set the expiration date as well as the maximum use of the code. 

- You would have a friend list which you can view all your friends and their profiles, as well as send or recieve friend requests.

- You could open your profile to public or private.

- <strong>This may not happen</strong> you could see posts that are related to you. (i dont know how i could achieve this. So this might not even happen.)

- You could see your friends and your communities' posts in your feed. As well as to like, comment and reshare them.

- You could also share posts, although they will be limited by the number of characters. Your post could include one or possibly more pictures, maybe videos, embedded links etc.

- You could later on delete, edit or archive your posts.

- You could point out issues regarding your community's work, such as bugs etc.

- You could report someone or a community if they are not following the community guidelines. Such as posting nudity or using slurs.

- Your community would have certain features in their sub-projects. Such as having a to-do list, a flowchart and other related stuff.
